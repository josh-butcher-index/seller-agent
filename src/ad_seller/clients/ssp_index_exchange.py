"""Index Exchange SSP client (REST API).

Index Exchange's REST API lives at the FQDN https://app.indexexchange.com.
Deal-management endpoints (this connector's concern) sit under a shared
/api/deals prefix, with /v3/deals beneath that for deal CRUD operations.
INDEX_EXCHANGE_API_URL is configured as just the FQDN — the /api/deals
prefix is applied in code (_API_BASE_PATH below) rather than baked into the
configured base URL, since /api/deals is only one of several path prefixes
under this host we expect to call as seller-agent's agentic workflows
expand. No MCP server yet (as of March 2026), though they're part of the
IAB Tech Lab Agentic RTB Framework (ARTF) coalition.

Key endpoints (FQDN + path):
  - POST   /api/deals/v3/deals              — Create a deal
  - GET    /api/deals/v3/deals               — List deals
  - GET    /api/deals/v3/deals/{id}          — Get a single deal (id = internalDealID)
  - PATCH  /api/deals/v3/deals/{id}          — Update a deal (requires If-Match ETag)
  - DELETE /api/deals/v3/deals/{id}          — Soft-delete a deal
  - GET    /api/deals/v3/deals/reports       — Deals data export
  - GET    /api/deals/v1/dsps/-/seats        — Resolve dspID(s) from seat IDs
    (see resolve_dsp_ids_for_seat_ids() below)

There is no clone/copy endpoint — clone_deal() below implements cloning by
composing get_deal() + create_deal() instead.

Field names and behavior here are derived directly from the Deals API (the
service implementing /v3/deals), not from public docs.

Known limitations:
  - dspID (directConfigurations.dspID for Direct deal types, or
    marketplaceConfigurations.dspID for Marketplace Package) is required for
    every deal type this connector supports, not just Direct. create_deal()
    will raise ValueError until request.dsp_id is supplied. Callers with
    only a buyer_seat_id (no dsp_id) should call
    resolve_dsp_ids_for_seat_ids() first — see distribute_deal_via_ssp() in
    interfaces/api/main.py for how ambiguous (>1 dspID) resolutions are
    gated behind human approval before create_deal() is called.
  - account.accountID is likewise not sourced anywhere upstream today —
    it's deliberately not a fixed deployment-wide setting, since a single
    seller-agent instance may need to create deals under more than one
    Index account, so it must be supplied per-request via
    SSPDealCreateRequest.account_id until callers are wired up to provide it.
  - No Keycloak JWT refresh: INDEX_EXCHANGE_API_KEY is treated as a
    long-lived token; production tokens expire and must be refreshed via
    the client-credentials grant, which is not implemented here.
  - The new Deals API `floorCurrency` field (create-only, feature-flagged)
    is not supported; all deals are assumed USD.
